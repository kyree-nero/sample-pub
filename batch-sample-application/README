This is a sample spring batch project

The following technologies are used 
-Spring Batch
-Stax

Note: spring batch admin is deprecated so for the 
ease of this example I've made exposed endoints to control the jobs

check the job status with this
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/status/{id}

start the job
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplebatchjob/start
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplepartitioningbatchjob/start
