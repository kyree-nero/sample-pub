This is a sample spring batch project

The following technologies are used 
-Spring Batch
-Stax

Note: spring batch admin is deprecated so for the  
ease of this example I've made exposed endoints to control the jobs

check the job status with this
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/status/{id}

start the job
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplebatchjob/start
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplepartitioningbatchjob/start
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simpleremotepartitioningbatchjob/start

Note.  to do the remote partition job both the master and slave binary need to be deployed to a container with a separate 
context root so they do not collide.
The test data also needs to be in the table (see the .sql files in test)
