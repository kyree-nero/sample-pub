This will house all of my core thread samples.

For now there is only one.   

1. Simple Producer/Consumer Example
@See SimpleProducerConsumerApplication
There is one producer that produces more widgets for a set amount 
of times each time a widget container is empty.  There are a few 
widget consumers that empty it in short order.

2. Simple Wait/Notify Example
@See SimpleWaitNotifyProducerConsumerApplication
There is one producer that produces a set amount of widgets.  There 
are multiple consumers.  Widgets are consumed and produced as there is 
room in the buffer for either operation.  Consumers and Producers in 
this example do not wait for the widgets to be completely exhausted or 
produced to continue operations
