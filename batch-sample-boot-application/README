This is a sample spring boot batch project

The following technologies are used 
-Spring Batch
-Stax

Note: spring batch admin is deprecated so for the  
ease of this example I've made exposed endoints to control the jobs

check the job status with this
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/status/{id}

start the job
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplebatchjob/start
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simplepartitioningbatchjob/start
http://localhost:8080/app/batch/simpleremotepartitioningbatchjob/start

Note.  to do the remote partition job both the master and slave binary need to be deployed to a container with a separate 
context root so they do not collide.
The test data also needs to be in the table (see the .sql files in test)

Note.   This uses activemq (standalone) on its default port for the run time to work.  You need to setup one queue called batchQueue.  
In test nothing is needed.
